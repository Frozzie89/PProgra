//Read this !!! 
//This program can have multiple tools in the same column.
//This program won't generate ALL the possibilities, instead it will generate the best possibility for each order (but it will generete every order possibility, order example : [5 4 6 3 1 2]).
//This program uses a GUI so answers won't be shown in console but you can see it's progress into it.
//Input matrix can be ordered but it will work anyway if it isn't since the program will order matrix before doing calculations.

//Next comment concern the optimized tab in GUI.
//CAUTION : The tools to keep in 0's are for 0's from up to down, left to right. (So first will be first column from top to bottom, next will be second column from top to bottom,...).
