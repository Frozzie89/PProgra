//This one won't generate ALL the possibilities, instead it will generate the best possibility for each order (order example : [5 4 6 3 1 2]).
//This program uses a GUI so answers won't be shown in console but you can see it's progress in console.
//input matrix can be ordered but it will work anyway if it isn't.
